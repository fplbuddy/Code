Going to change so that we can output as many fields and 2d spectra as we can speactra
-----
V2.9
-----
11 June
Some bug fixes and also output theta 2d spectrum
-----
v2.10
-----
15 June
Have possibility of random ICs
-----
v2.11
-----
26 June
Includes e/o energy decomp
-----
v2.12
-----
20 Aug
Added so that MATLAB can be used as ICs
-----
v2.13
-----
9 Aug
Added pert and set up a new ICs which converges to the even steady state
-----
23 Nov
I have tried to amend IC.5 so that it takes N = 172. Hopefully it will work. It seems to!
-----
24 Nov
Have made slight amendment to IC.6 so that it can take Matlab as ICs. Have also added some comments. There is PLENTY of cleaning that needs to be done.

21 Feb
-----
The perturbation can include even modes now
Another IC which is the new steady state that we have found. Both odd and even modes
Have added matlabeig

Remove znl
Remove kxone, kmanyx 
Faster oeenergy subrut
Think I have fixed the Matlab input
