-Also In the CFL cond. Should we not have dx = 2*pi*Lx*3/nx?? So Basically, our time steps are a factor of 2*pi too small. Have tried to change this and did not seem to get reversal? Very strange. Possibly worth asking Vassilios.

- When load in data from Maltab in DNS, I think sometimes there is nx/2*(j-1). Should be ny/2*(j-1). Ofc not a problem if nx = ny.
